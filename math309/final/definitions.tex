\textbf{vector space}: A vector space $V$ over a field $F$ consists of a set on which two operations (called \textbf{addition} and \textbf{scalar multiplication}) are defined so that for each pair of elements $x,y \in V$ there is a unique element $x+y$ in $V$, and for each element $a$ in $F$ and each element $x$ in $V$ there is a unique elemnt $ax$ in $V$, such that the following conditions hold: ...

\textbf{subspace}: A subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is called a \textbf{subspace} of $V$ if $W$ is a vector space over $F$ with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on $V$.

\textbf{linear combination}: Let $V$ be a vector space and $S$ a nonempty subset of $V$. A vector $v \in V$ is called a \textbf{linear combination} of vectors of $S$ if there exist a finite number of vectors $u_1,u_2,..,u_n$ in $S$ and scalars $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ in $F$ such that $v = a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \cdots + a_n u_n$. In this case we also say that $v$ is a linear combination of $u_1,u_2,...,u_n$ and call $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ the coefficients of the linear combination.

\textbf{span}: Let $S$ be a nonempty subset of a vector space $V$. The \textbf{span} of $S$, denoted $span(S)$, is the set consisting of all linear combinations of the vectors in $S$. For convenience, we define $span(0) = {0}$.

\textbf{linearly dependent}: A subset $S$ of a vector space $V$ is called \textbf{linearly depenedent} if there exist a finite number of distinct vectors $u_1,u_2,...,u_n$ in $S$ and scalars $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$, not all zero such that
$$a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \cdots + a_n u_n = 0$$

\textbf{basis}: A \textbf{basis} $\beta$ for a vector space $V$ is a linearly indepenedent subset of $V$ that generates $V$. If $\beta$ is a basis for $V$, we also say that the vectors of $\beta$ form a basiss for $V$.
